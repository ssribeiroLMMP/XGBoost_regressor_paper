\section{Extreme gradient boosting}
\label{sec:XGBoost}

According to Zhi-Hua Zhou\cite{zhou2012ensemble}, boosting algorithms are a group of algorithms that sequentially applies weak learners to achieve strong learning by the end. The extreme gradient boosting\cite{chen2016xgboost} is an optimized implementation of the gradient boosting framework proposed by Friedman et al.\cite{friedman2000additive},\cite{friedman2001greedy}. In this algorithm, each weak learn is made by a decision tree,
