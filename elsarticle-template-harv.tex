\begin{abstract}

% The oil and gas industry has a vital role in the global economy. Due to the financial impact, an efficient operation is a target that many companies look for. With the capability to predict the production of oil and gas, companies are able to optimize their operations and costs, improving their operational efficiency more and more. In order to overcome this issue, many companies use reservoir simulation software to predict production. Nonetheless, this approach to solving the problem requires a huge computational cost and a reliable geological model. Both of the requirements are expensive, and a reliable geological model of the reservoir is another issue that the industry has. With the advantage of artificial intelligence resources, companies can use their owners' amount of data in order to make data-driven models to overcome many industries' issues, including the production forecast. In this study, a machine learning model was used to predict the oil and gas production from a wellbore, making use of the time series from the sensors along the wellbore regions. The results showed the relevance of the feature engineering process and the capability of the model to predict oil and gas based on the available data.

The world economy greatly depends on the oil and gas industry. An efficient operation is a goal that many firms pursue due to its financial impact. Companies are able to optimize their production and costs, increasing their operational efficiency as a result of their ability to predict the production of oil and gas. Many businesses employ reservoir simulation software to forecast production to get around this problem. However, this method of issue-solving necessitates a solid geological model and a high computing cost. Both of the requirements are expensive, and the sector also faces a problem with a trustworthy geological model of the reservoir. With the use of artificial intelligence resources, businesses can take advantage of the vast amounts of data that belong to their owners to create data-driven models that address problems common to many industries, such as production forecasting. The data series from the sensors along the wellbore areas were utilized in this study to train a machine-learning model to forecast the oil and gas output from a wellbore. The outcomes demonstrated the applicability of the feature engineering procedure and the model's capacity to forecast oil and gas based on the available data.


% The forecast of oil and gas production is essential for the industry's efficient operation.


% Forecasting oil and gas production is essential for the industry to operate efficiently. Companies can optimize their operations, streamline costs, and remain competitive by accurately predicting production levels. In the past, predicting production levels was a challenging task that relied on historical data and intuition. Still, with the advancement of machine learning models such as XGBoost, companies can now make data-driven decisions and leverage the power of predictive analytics to gain a competitive edge. The relevance of forecasting in the oil and gas industry cannot be overstated, and accurate predictions are crucial for maintaining profitability and ensuring sustainable growth.
